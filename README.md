# Ensemble — spatial instrument

A room of phones becomes an instrument. The host plays notes and places their
source in a shared room map. Each phone synthesizes a Tone.js voice at the same
scheduled time, with its level determined by its distance from the source.

Built from [ensemble-AVInteractiveCircleMod](https://github.com/notreallyzoh/ensemble-AVInteractiveCircleMod).
The original shared-track player, live stream, clock synchronization, room
mapping and speaker controls remain under **Tracks, invitations & room setup**.

## Play the first version

The new **crowd A/V stage** adds two polyrhythm lanes, scheduled fullscreen phone
visuals, screen previews, light cues, blackout, and live setup diagnostics with
automatic timing guard. See [the show and diagnostics guide](docs/LIVE-SHOW.md)
for the first-device test, Cloudflare deployment, chat-accessible reports and
the next experiments.

```bash
node server.js
```

1. Open **http://localhost:8080** on the host and choose **Start a session**.
2. Click **Invite phones**. On the same Wi-Fi, scan the QR or open the LAN URL
   printed in the terminal. Enter the room code and tap **Join**. Each phone
   needs its own audio activation; keep its page visible and screen awake.
3. Click **Arrange in circle**, then **Place speakers** and drag each numbered
   phone to match the room. You can also enter X/Y coordinates in metres.
   A circle is an initial arrangement you assign, not a measurement.
4. Choose **Start instrument**. Touch/drag the field to scatter notes, or play
   the D-minor-pentatonic buttons with **A S D F G H J K**. The selected note
   stays fixed as you move its source. Spread controls how widely sound is shared.
5. Start with **100 ms gesture lead**. Use **Estimate gesture lead**, then play
   and watch the late-note counters. Increase the lead when notes miss deadlines.
   This setting is separate from the older file/stream sync buffer.

Arrow keys move the source when the field has focus; Enter plays. **Escape** or
**Silence notes** cancels current and queued instrument voices. **Mute this
speaker** also lets a laptop act only as the host controller.

No build or network dependency is needed to run locally: Tone.js **15.1.22**,
PeerJS and the QR generator are vendored with licenses. `npm ci` installs pinned
development dependencies; `npm run vendor` refreshes the Tone.js bundle from the
installed version.

### Positions and sensors

Manual placement works on plain HTTP. The existing acoustic mapper uses phone
microphones to estimate distances; it requires a secure context. Its **Apply
to devices** action now saves coordinates as well as roles and trims. **Use
acoustic map** imports just the coordinates into the instrument, keeping timing
trims unchanged. Check the inferred map against the physical room.

**Detect movement** is optional and requests sensor permission where required.
It reminds the host to update a moved phone; it does not integrate acceleration
into an invented position. Denied or unsupported sensors do not block playing.

For local HTTPS, use a certificate covering the host's LAN address and trusted
by every participating device. With those files in place, PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:TLS_CERT = 'C:\certs\ensemble-cert.pem'
$env:TLS_KEY = 'C:\certs\ensemble-key.pem'
node server.js
```

Both variables must be set. A certificate warning bypass does not establish a
reliable secure context; provision device trust before trying microphone or
motion features. Static HTTPS hosting remains available through the existing
Pages workflow and uses the original PeerJS mode. Nothing is automatically
published by local setup.

### Verification and next steps

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run test:browser
```

Browser tests use an installed Chrome and a separate server on port 8091. They
cover independent host/phone sessions, audio-graph output, note distribution,
late-drop handling, mute, panic, placement, mobile layout and legacy file playback.
These checks **do not establish acoustic synchronization across physical phones**.

for findings, browser constraints, localization options and an in-room test plan.

## Original playback modes

**Hosted (GitHub Pages).** The whole app is static, so it can live on Pages.
There is no server, so the host's own tab holds the room and every other device
connects to it directly over WebRTC. Push this repo and turn Pages on:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Then **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**. The included workflow
publishes `public/` on every push to `main`, and the app goes live at
the Pages URL shown in this repository's deployment settings.

A public PeerJS broker handles the initial handshake only — the offer/answer
exchange. Audio, control messages and clock traffic go device to device and
never touch it.

**Local (no internet at all).** A tiny Node server holds the room instead:

```bash
node server.js
```

It prints a LAN address; every device on the same Wi-Fi opens it. Useful on a
network with no internet, and the track transfers over HTTP instead of WebRTC.

Both modes speak the same protocol — `public/room-core.js` is the single room
state machine, loaded by the Node server and by the host's browser tab alike.
The app picks its mode automatically; `?mode=p2p` or `?mode=ws` forces one.

> secure context. That means the hosted build, or `localhost` — a plain-http LAN
> address cannot use `getUserMedia`, and the app will tell you so.

## Live streaming

The host can stream whatever it is playing instead of sharing a file. **Stream
what I'm playing** opens the browser's share picker; pick a tab (or a screen)
and tick the audio box.

It is not a voice call under the hood. The host captures the audio, cuts it into
23 ms chunks, and stamps each one with the instant it should be *heard* —
capture time plus a fixed buffer. Every device, the host included, schedules
that chunk for exactly that instant. Nobody plays a chunk when it arrives; they
play it when the clock says to. The upstream README reports playback cursors
0.1 ms apart on two machines; this has not been independently reproduced here
and is not a microphone measurement of speaker alignment.

- The buffer is the **sync buffer** in the Sync tab. 700 ms is a good default;
  shorter feels more immediate and risks gaps on weak Wi-Fi.
- Audio goes out as Opus at about 130 kbps per listener (raw PCM if the browser
  has no WebCodecs), and it is distributed through a tree rather than a star —
  see below.
- Channel modes still apply, so a streamed source can still be split into a
  stereo pair or a 5.1 layout.
- **Mute the host's own speakers.** The source keeps playing out of the host
  directly, with no delay, so if you do not mute it you will hear the room twice.
- What can be captured depends on the browser: Chrome on **macOS** can take the
  audio of a *Chrome tab* (so use Spotify/YouTube's web player), not the whole
  system — full system audio there needs a virtual device such as BlackHole.
  Chrome on **Windows** can share entire-screen audio.

## Scaling to a roomful of devices

A star cannot carry 50 devices, and the reason is not bandwidth. Wi-Fi hands out
airtime **per station**: with 50 stations contending, the host is entitled to
about 1/50 of the medium, while a star requires it to transmit 49 copies of
every chunk — 49/50 of the airtime. No access point fixes that.

| | per stream | host must send | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| PCM s16 | 1.41 Mbps | 69 Mbps | impossible |
| Opus 128k, star | ~184 kbps on the wire | 8.8 Mbps | one station, 49 flows — fails under contention |
| Opus 128k, fanout 4 | ~184 kbps | **736 kbps** | fits inside a 1/50 share |

So two changes. **Opus** cuts each stream about elevenfold. **A distribution
tree** spreads the transmitting across the stations that are already in the
room: the host feeds four devices, each of those feeds four more. Fifty devices
fit in three hops, and no device ever uploads more than ~736 kbps.

Total airtime is the same either way — a star and a tree both have N−1 edges,
about 9 Mbps aggregate, 5–10% of a 5 GHz channel. The tree changes *who*
transmits, which is the thing that actually breaks.

Relaying is free in sync terms, and that is the whole trick: every chunk already
carries the instant it must be heard, so another hop changes when it *arrives*,
never when it *plays*. Three hops spend about 24 ms of a 700 ms buffer.

Each node looks after its own hop rather than trusting a global view: it probes
its parent every few seconds, reports that round trip to the host, and asks to
be re-parented when the link dies. The host re-plans the tree whenever anyone
joins or leaves, and tells only the devices that actually moved.

The clock deliberately does *not* go hop by hop. On one Wi-Fi network every
device is a single radio hop from the host, so measuring against the host
directly is more accurate than composing a chain of estimates — each hop would
add its own error. Timing is star-shaped and cheap (about 1 kbps per device);
only audio and failure handling are per-hop. On a multi-AP or mesh network that
trade would flip, and boundary-clock style sync would win.

The upstream README reports four devices, one running a 48 kHz audio context against a
44.1 kHz capture: **playback cursors within 0.22 ms**, zero re-anchors, zero
gaps, Opus at 132 kbps.

## Latency

Delay and scale are the same dial, because Wi-Fi airtime is dominated by
per-frame overhead rather than payload. Halving the Opus frame halves the
latency floor and doubles the packet rate, and packets are what saturate the
medium — so the room's size picks the frame size automatically (5–10 ms for a
handful of devices, 40–60 ms for a crowd). Frames must also be a whole number
of samples at the capture rate: 5 ms at 44.1 kHz is 220.5 samples, and rounding
that slips the stream 2.6 ms every second.

The buffer is measured, not guessed. Every listener reports the slack its worst
chunk had — how long before its deadline it actually arrived — and **Calibrate
latency** walks the buffer down 20 ms at a time until the first device runs out
of margin or drops a sample, then settles at that floor plus a margin. In normal
running the buffer only ever goes *up*, and quickly: a continuously descending
buffer has every device chasing a moving target, which turned 0.2 ms of spread
into 9 ms. Find the floor deliberately, then hold it.

A device that struggles alone asks the host for a **second parent** rather than
making everyone else wait: two disjoint paths, and whichever copy of a chunk
lands first wins. That halves nothing on average and everything in the tail,
which is where dropouts live.

The upstream README reports a three-device room: 700 ms → **173 ms** buffer, cursors within
**0.35 ms**, zero gaps. These are upstream cursor measurements, not validated
performance guarantees for this instrument or a new room.

## How the sync works

Streaming audio to N devices and hoping they keep up does not work: every device
has its own clock and its own output latency. Ensemble does what Snapcast and
AirPlay do — distribute the file first, agree on a clock, then schedule the same
sample for the same instant.

1. **Distribute, don't stream.** The host shares the file once; every device
   decodes it into an `AudioBuffer` before anything plays. Over HTTP in LAN mode,
   over a data channel in P2P mode (64 KB chunks, paced against the send buffer).

2. **Agree on a clock.** Each device runs a continuous NTP-style exchange with
   the room's timekeeper. Only the fastest quarter of samples are kept — a slow
   round trip means an asymmetric path, and an asymmetric path is exactly what
   biases an NTP offset. A least-squares fit over those samples also estimates
   *skew*: the parts-per-million difference between two quartz crystals, which is
   what makes naive sync drift apart over a long track.

3. **Schedule, don't start.** Every command carries an absolute timestamp plus a
   sync buffer (300 ms – 2.5 s, the host's choice). Each device converts that
   instant through `getOutputTimestamp()` — which reports the sample *currently
   audible*, so output latency is measured rather than guessed — and calls
   `source.start(when, offset)` with sample accuracy.

4. **Correct continuously.** Every 700 ms a device compares where the room says
   the playhead should be against where its own audible playhead is, and bends
   `playbackRate` by up to ±2% to close the gap. Under 3 ms it does nothing; over
   250 ms it re-schedules from scratch. (Snapcast does the same by inserting and
   dropping samples.) That loop runs on a timer, never on `requestAnimationFrame`,
   so a phone with a dark screen stays in step.

5. **Compensate per device.** Bluetooth speakers add 100–300 ms that no protocol
   can discover. **Measure speaker delay** emits a chirp, hears it back through
   the mic, and times the loop; **Auto-align** then delays every device to match
   the slowest.

The upstream README reports two machines on a LAN: sub-millisecond agreement, settling
inside the 3 ms deadband. Peer-to-peer, where the reference is a browser tab
rather than a server, it holds within about 10 ms.

## Channel modes

**Stereo & roles** — shares of a stereo mix: Stereo, Mono, Wide (mid/side with a
Haas delay), Left, Right, Vocals (band-limited centre), Ambience (the stereo
difference), Bass (under 150 Hz), Highs (over 2.2 kHz).

**Surround 5.1 / 7.1** — one device *is* one speaker: Front L, Center, Front R,
Surround L, Surround R, LFE, Rear L, Rear R.

- With a **discrete multichannel file**, each device decodes the whole file and
  plays only its own channel, in standard order (FL FR FC LFE SL SR RL RR).
- With ordinary **stereo**, the missing channels are matrix-upmixed in the spirit
  of Pro Logic II: centre from the mid signal, fronts with the centre partly
  subtracted so it is not doubled, LFE from a low-passed mono sum, surrounds from
  the side signal delayed 18–38 ms and band-limited.
- **Auto-assign layout** hands out positions in one tap, scaled to the number of
  devices: two become L/R, three add a centre, six make a 5.1, eight a 7.1.

## The room map

Phones know where they are relative to each other, if you let them listen.

Each device emits a 24 ms chirp (2→6 kHz) at an agreed instant while the others
record; a matched filter finds the arrival to sub-sample precision. For a pair
*i, j*:

```
dt_ij + dt_ji = L_i + L_j + 2·distance/343
```

where `L` is each device's own speaker→mic loop time. Every unknown per-device
constant cancels, and the distance falls out. Classical multidimensional scaling
turns the distance matrix into 2D coordinates; the host defines "front", the
listener sits at the centroid, and roles are assigned by angle. Distances cannot
tell left from right — a mirrored room fits the data equally well — so the map
has a **Mirror** button rather than pretending to know.

**Apply to devices** then sets each role *and* its delay: near speakers are held
back so every wavefront reaches the middle together, the way an AV receiver uses
speaker distances.

Against synthetic geometry with ±0.5 ms of jitter, pairwise distances came back
within 13 cm and every surround role landed on the right device. In a real room,
expect reverb and noise to matter more than the maths.

## Device sensors

- **Wake Lock** — the screen sleeping is the most common way a device drops out.
- **Battery** — level and charging state reach the host, so a speaker about to
  die is visible before it dies.
- **Motion** — shake to resync; put the phone face-down to mute it.
- **Haptics** — a muted phone still pulses on the beat.
- **Connection** — link quality, which informs the sync buffer.

Each one degrades quietly where the browser does not expose it (iOS has no
Battery API, desktops have no motion sensors).

## Why there is no Bluetooth mesh

A web page cannot send audio over Bluetooth. Web Bluetooth is GATT only — there
is no API for A2DP, LE Audio or Auracast — and iOS Safari does not implement Web
Bluetooth at all. It would also be the wrong direction for quality: Bluetooth
re-encodes with a lossy codec and adds 100–300 ms of its own latency. Each phone
decoding the full-quality file locally and playing it against a shared clock
beats it on both counts. If a phone is itself feeding a Bluetooth speaker, the
delay measurement above is what compensates for it.

## Limits

- The instrument transmits note events; it does not remove the latency of live
  captured audio. File playback and the existing buffered live-capture mode have
  separate timing behavior and should be evaluated separately.
- Peer-to-peer mode assumes devices can reach each other directly, which is the
  normal case on one Wi-Fi network. Across separate networks WebRTC would need a
  TURN relay, which is not included.
- Tracks live in memory (200 MB cap in LAN mode) and disappear with the room.
- The public PeerJS broker is a free shared service. For anything serious, run
  your own — it is one npm package — and point `PEER_PREFIX`/`Peer()` at it in
  `public/net.js`.
